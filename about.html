        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>An idea to give people the news and nothing but!</p>
        <p>
          Simplify News was born out of a desire to cut through the noise and deliver clean,
          focused updates. What started as a small side project grew into a dedicated space for
          EV news, with a special spotlight on Tesla.

        <p>
          Since purchasing my Tesla Model 3, sustainability has become more than a buzzword —
          it’s a guiding principle for my life. Driving the Model 3 brought clarity to my goals,
          inspiring me to create a news platform that promotes innovation, renewable energy,
          and the future of clean transportation.
